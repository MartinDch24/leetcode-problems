# LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository contains my ongoing solutions to algorithm and data structure problems, primarily from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). My goal is to improve problem-solving skills through consistent daily practice, with a long-term objective of preparing for top-tier technical interviews.

---

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- Clean, Python solutions
- Revisited and optimized implementations of older problems
- Experiments with different traversal strategies and problem variations

---

## Goals

- Strengthen understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms
- Build a strong foundation for problem solving
- Create a transparent, public portfolio of my technical progress

---

## ðŸ› Future Improvements

- Categorize problems by topic (e.g., Graphs, Trees, DP, Greedy)
- Add time/space complexity analysis to each solution

---

## Why This Exists

Consistency is a core part of my preparation strategy. This repository represents not just completed problems, but the discipline and structure that go into long-term technical growth. Itâ€™s an open record of improvement over time.
